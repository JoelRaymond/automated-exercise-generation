Pre-meeting plan (progress)
  - Changed step-by-step KMP visuals (progression and highlighting borders)
  - Redesigned UI to be separate for each algorithm for scalability
  - Dijkstra questions now explain edge weights and show adjacency matrices

Questions
  - Edge weights are about as good as they can get (maybe changes for user study)

Next Week
  - Implementation
  - Requirements

Meeting Notes
  - Number each algorithm
  - Make it clear that you can generate 
  - KMP solution clarification in words
  - Show next step in Dijkstra (make table more clear)
  - Change step-by-step dijkstra question
  - Highlight next edge
  - Change size of graph
  - Requirements for exercises themselves (user stories)
