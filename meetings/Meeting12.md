Pre-meeting plan (progress)
  - Changed step-by-step KMP visuals (progression and highlighting borders)
  - Redesigned UI to be separate for each algorithm for scalability
  - Dijkstra questions now explain edge weights and show adjacency matrices

Questions
  - Edge weights are about as good as they can get (maybe changes for user study)

Next Week
  - Implementation?
  - User study?
  - Proofs?
