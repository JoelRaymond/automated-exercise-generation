Pre-meeting plan (progress)
  - Changed step-by-step KMP visuals (progression and highlighting borders)
  - Redesigned UI to be separate for each algorithm for scalability
  - Dijkstra questions now explain edge weights and show adjacency matrices

Questions
  - 

Next Week
  - Implementation?
  - User study?
  - Proofs?

Meeting Notes
  - KMP use different colours for border
  - Bold progression KMP
  - Accessibility
  - Separate Dijkstra and KMP
  - Include adjacency matrix
  - Explain edge weights
  - Varying edge thickness
  - Weights on the edge
  - Requirements for exercises
