Pre-meeting plan (progress)
  - Changed step-by-step KMP visuals (progression and highlighting borders)
  - Redesigned UI to be separate for each algorithm for scalability
  - Dijkstra questions now explain edge weights and show adjacency matrices

Questions
  - Combining requirements

Next Week
  - Implementation
  - Requirements
