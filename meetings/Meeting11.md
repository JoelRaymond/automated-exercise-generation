Pre-meeting plan (Agenda/Christmas break progress)
  - Implemented solution generation
  - Implemented step-by-step solution generation
  - Refactored some code
  - Fixed bugs in generation algorithm
  - Refined visualisation

Questions
  - Overlapping edge weights (difficult to see)

Next Week
  - Work on implementation

Meeting Notes
  - KMP use different colours for border
  - Bold progression KMP
  - Accessibility
  - Separate Dijkstra and KMP
  - Include adjacency matrix
  - Explain edge weights
  - Varying edge thickness
  - Weights on the edge
  - Requirements for exercises
