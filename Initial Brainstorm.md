Algorithms generated for
 - Chosen from section 2 (Strings and text algorithms) and section 3 (graphs and graphing algorithms), since other sections are too theoretical
 - Ones that can be easily broken down into parameters
 - Border table / string search using KMP
 - Shortest path (Dijkstra) (difficulty can be easily varied based on weights)

Technologies used
 - Java (OOP, JavaFX, familiarity)
