Question: 
Find the shortest paths, and their lengths, from vertex v1 to each other vertices in the graph shown below.

Properties:
  - 7-9 vertices RECOMMENDED (input depending on difficulty, kept uniform)
  - 1-23 weight values randomly generated (for not too difficult calculations)
  - 12 edges for 7 vertices, 16 edges for 8 vertices, 21 edges for 9 vertices RECOMMENDED, allowed up to complete (same ratio, to keep uniform difficulty across number of vertices input)
  - Connected (No redundant nodes)
  - Pseudo random edge placement, ensuring somewhat even distribution and outside circle
  - To eliminate multiple answers either: have unique weights OR have generally larger weights on the inside OR just give multiple answers in solution OR ...
  - Vertices displayed in order in a circle
